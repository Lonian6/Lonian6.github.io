    We propose MuseControlLite, a lightweight fine-tuning mechanism that uses rotary positional embeddings and decoupled cross-attention to achieve precise, time-varying control over music generation. This model achieves superior melody accuracy while requiring nearly 7 times fewer trainable parameters than state-of-the-art ControlNet-based architectures. It is the first framework to simultaneously handle musical attribute control (melody, rhythm, and dynamics) alongside reference audio for seamless inpainting and outpainting.
